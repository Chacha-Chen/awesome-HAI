# Awesome HCI + ML List

Curator: Bryan Wang ([Website](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~bryanw/)).

There has been a rising trend of applying new __machine learning__ algorithms, especially __deep learning__, to solve __Human-Computer Interaction__ problems. As a grad student studying HCI, I want to know _how_ these papers select models and apply to them to _what_ kind of scenarios. However, it seems like so far there is no single entry to all these awesome resources. Therefore I started to maintain this awesome list on 2/19/2019.
