# Awesome HCI + DL [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)


There has been a rising trend of applying __Deep Learning__, or __AI__, to solve __Human-Computer Interaction__ problems. And it's awesome to see _what problems_ HCI researchers are solving with deep learning and what _challenges_ that occur when designing AI-infused interfaces! 

However, there seems to be no curation for all these awesome HCI + DL/ Human-AI Interaction resources so far. That's why we do this!
