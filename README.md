# Awesome HCI + ML List

Curator: Bryan Wang ([Website](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~bryanw/)).

There has been a rising trend of applying new __machine learning__/__deep learning__ models, or the buzzword __AI__, to solve __Human-Computer Interaction__ problems. 

However, it seems like so far there is no single entry to all these HCI + ML/ Human-AI Interaction resources. That's why we started to maintain this list. 

This list will broadly include the articles/courses that are related to HCI + AI or HCI + ML and that we are intersted in.
