# Awesome HCI + DL List

Curator: Bryan Wang ([Website](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~bryanw/)), Joe Hsu.

There has been a rising trend of applying __Deep Learning__ models, or the buzzword __AI__, to solve __Human-Computer Interaction__ problems. 

However, it seems like so far there is no single entry to all these HCI + DL/ Human-AI Interaction resources. That's why we started to maintain this list. 

This list will broadly include the articles/courses that are related to HCI + AI or HCI + DL and that we are intersted in.
