![image](https://github.com/bwang514/awesome-HAI/blob/master/Human-AI%20Interaction.png)

Awesome HAI is **a collection of academic materials related to the topic of Human-AI interaction.**
* We include both research papers that discuss challenges and opportunities in interaction design with general AI from the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) perspective and that specifically discuss how advances in Deep Learning can address interactive challenges from the AI perspective. We also include Human-AI Interaction courses from universities worldwide. 
* The collection is maintained by a community of volunteered students, make a pull request if you want to contribute :)
